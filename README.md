Christian Factor — Commissions & Projects Repository

This repository contains various client commissions, practice projects, and school-related tasks that I have worked on.  
Each folder represents one project, complete with its own files and structure.

I use this repository as a collection of:
- ✔ Small commissions  
- ✔ Frontend layouts  
- ✔ JavaScript practice  
- ✔ App prototypes  
- ✔ Camera-related mini projects  
- ✔ School projects and capstone drafts
